We are learning git commands today 
we learned about 
'got branch' it is used to make copies of out code that we can edit distinctly from
other parts of teh project
example usage:
git branch <my_new_branch>
git checkout <my_new_branch>
git branch -a #ot check that we are now on the new branch!

Another command it 'git add', it is used to add a file to our project

git add my_new_file.txt
git status # list new files or changes
git diff # show changes
